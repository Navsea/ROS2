CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:27 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findsensor_fusion_msg_types.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH
  this project has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided
  by "sensor_fusion_msg_types", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by
  "sensor_fusion_msg_types" with any of the following names:

    sensor_fusion_msg_typesConfig.cmake
    sensor_fusion_msg_types-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "sensor_fusion_msg_types" to
  CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set "sensor_fusion_msg_types_DIR" to a directory
  containing one of the above files.  If "sensor_fusion_msg_types" provides a
  separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been installed.
